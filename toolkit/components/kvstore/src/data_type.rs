// Instead we have to reflect each variant into a constant and then match
// against the values of the constants.

// (Alternatively, we could use the enum_primitive crate to convert primitive
// values of nsIVariant::dataType to their enum equivalents.  Or perhaps
// bindgen would convert the nsXPTTypeTag enum in xptinfo.h into something else
// we could use.  Since we currently only accept a small subset of values,
// and since that enum is unlikely to change frequently, this workaround
// seems sufficient.)
